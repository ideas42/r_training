# What is R?

- R was a language for statistical computing and graphics, but it's grown to be much more than that.

- In that sense it's similar to Stata and other statistical computing programs like SPSS or SAS. BUT there's other stuff too.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[What's similar?]

### Things that are similar

- You open datasets
- You wrangle data
- You analyze it
- You report results

]
.panel[.panel-name[What's different?]

### Things that are different

- You can have multiple datasets
- You have an actual programming language
- You have incredible flexibility
- The world is your oyster

## E.g. Bill depth and bill length are correlated in penguins

```{r, echo = FALSE}



p <- penguins %>%
  mutate(id = row_number(),
         tooltip = paste("I'm a", species, "penguin from", island, "island")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
             y = bill_depth_mm,
             color = species)) +
  geom_point_interactive(aes(tooltip = tooltip, data_id = id ), alpha = 0.5, size = 2.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  theme_ipsum_tw() +
  scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette("Darjeeling1")) +
  facet_wrap(~island)
  

girafe(code = print(p), width_svg = 12, height_svg = 5)

## What about RStudio?

Rstudio is the most commonly used IDE (integrated development environment) for programming with R

Link to download: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

---

## Before we start

`R` works with packages. Packages **expand the universe of things** you can do with `R`, often in spectacular fashion. 

- To keep things simple, we'll just be installing the `tidyverse` family of packages, and the `gapminder` package, which we'll be using to explore the gapminder dataset.

- To install these, just run these two commands in the console:

```{r, eval= FALSE}

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("gapminder")

```

- You only need to install packages once in your computer. Once you do that, you can just load them when you need it (typically at the beginning.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

```

---

# Data types

The most basic data structure in R is a vector.

- Vectors have one dimension (think of it as a line)

- Vectors can be **numeric**, **character**,  **logical**...

- But they must all share the same type!

Here are some examples:

```{r}
#You can create a vector by using the assignment operator
my_letters <- c("a", "b", "c")

my_numbers <- c(1,2,3)

# Now let's see what happens if we mix
all_mixed <-c("a", 2, "b", 3)

```

---

## A vector is a vector is a data frame

And what's a dataset? It's just a bunch of **vectors** stuck together, vertically.

```{r}

sheep_name <- c("Molly", "Polly", "Dolly")
sheep_weight <- c(120, 90, 85)
sheep_age <- c(3,4,2)

my_sheep <- data.frame(sheep_name, sheep_weight, sheep_age)

```

Let's print it out:

```{r}

my_sheep

```

---

## Data importing and wrangling

- We don't always build datasets this way, but it's useful as a **mental model**.

- Typically we do just like in Stata, and we **read in** some data.

- To do that, we will use the family of `read_*` functions available as part of the `tidyverse`. You'll find an example at the end of your script, to look at post-training.

- For our training, we'll just use the `gapminder` dataset, which we can call using `data(gapminder)`, since it's already installed with the package.

```{r}

data(gapminder)

```

Can you all see it?

---
## Let's talk grammar

There are several verbs available for data wrangling. We'll take a look at these:

- `select()`
- `filter()`
- `mutate()`
- `arrange()`
- `summarize()`
- `group_by()`

With these 6 tools, you should be able to do about 90% of the things you want to do when wrangling data.

### For the other 10%: Google + Stackoverflow are your friends.

---

## Taking a look 

Let's take a look at our dataset. You can look at the first 5 observations by using `head()`:

```{r}

head(gapminder)

```

---

## Taking a look 

You can also use `summary()` to get an overview of the dataset:

```{r}

summary(gapminder)

```

---

## Select variables and filter observations

Use `select` to pick and choose **variables**, and `filter` to pick and choose **observations**.

A great thing in `R` is that you don't lose your data. You can just create a **new, updated object.**

Let's keep only the `country`, `year`, and `lifeExp` variables.

```{r}

df_redux <- select(gapminder, country, year, lifeExp)

head(df_redux)

```


---

## Select variables and filter observations

Now let's try using `filter()`. You can filter by any condition! Here we'll filter by year and country.

```{r}

df_filtered <- filter(gapminder, year == 1957, country == "Belgium")

df_filtered
```
---

## You can also combine these easily

.pull-left[

- Enter the pipe: `%>%`

- Think of the pipe as "...and then..."

- The pipe allows you to chain operations, and will make your life easier

- Let's try filtering by continent and year, and keeping three variables:

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Oceania", year == 2007) %>%
  select(continent, country, lifeExp)

```

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="This is not a pipe.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pipe.jpeg")
```
]




---

## Reference: `select()`

Select by column name:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  select(country)
```

Select by column position:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  select(1:2)
```

Select all columns except the first:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  select(-1)
```

---

## Reference: `filter()`

Combine multiple expressions with a comma, or `&`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe" & year == 2007)
```

Use the `|` operator when you want either-or filtering:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe" | continent == "Americas")
```

An exclamation point negates something. So to keep all **non-missing observations** you can do:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(!is.na(continent))
```

---


## Mutate to create (or change) variables

- We can use the `mutate()` verb to create or modify variables using all common operations (e.g. adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, taking the log). 

- Note that we don't have a GDP variable! Let's create it by multiplying GDP per capita times the population, and save the result as a new dataframe.

```{r}

df_gdp <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)

head(df_gdp)

```
---

## Mutate to create (or change) variables

Ok, that's quite big. We could also divide it by 1,000,000 to have it in US$ million, or even take the log!

```{r}

df_gdp <- df_gdp %>%
  mutate(gdp_million = gdp / 1000000,
         gdp_log = log(gdp))

head(df_gdp)
```

---

## Arrange to sort your dataframes

- Let's see what was the country with the lowest life expectancy in 1957:

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1957) %>%
  arrange(lifeExp) %>%
  head(3) # You can use head to restrict the output to any number of observations

```

---

## Arrange to sort your dataframes

What about the highest?

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1957) %>%
  arrange(desc(lifeExp)) %>%
  head(3)

```

---

## Summarize your data

- Very often, we're interested in calculating means, counts, medians, standard deviations.

- These are all **summary stats** and we can calculate them with `summarize()`.

- For example, imagine we're interested in the mean, median, and sd of life expectancy in 2007:

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  summarize(exp_mean = mean(lifeExp),
            exp_median = median(lifeExp),
            exp_sd = sd(lifeExp))

```


---

## Groups of things

- But more often, we care about summarizing across groups! This comes up all the time in our work.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(exp_mean = mean(lifeExp),
            gdp_mean = mean(gdpPercap))

```

- Note that `group_by()` doesn't produce any output, it just groups things in advance of whatever operation comes afterwards (typically, `summarize()`

---

## Your turn to code

- Can you find what was the **mean** and **median GDP per capita** (as well as the **number of obs!**) for **each of the continents in 1982**?

- You have **2 minutes**.

---

## Your turn to code

```{r}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>% # Filter to keep only 1982
  group_by(continent) %>% # Group by continent
  summarize(mean = mean(gdpPercap), # Calculate each of the summary stats with summarize
            median = median(gdpPercap),
            count = n())

```

---

## Reference: Other useful wrangling functions

- `distinct()` to select unique rows from a data frame

- `top_n()` to filter the top n observations (you can use it in combination
with `arrange()`)

- `ntile()` ranks values into the number of groups you provide

- `rename()` to change the name of the variables in your data frame

- All functions: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html

---

## Bonus: Running a regression

- R was designed for statistical computing, so there's a ton of built-in functions for stats work.

- Let's try running a regression. We won't have time to cover this in depth, but it's something most of us will have to do at ideas42.

- Use `lm` to run a linear model and `glm` to run a logit (that stands for Generalized Linear Model). These generate an object you can then save.  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df_1982 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1982)
```  

```{r}

my_ols <- lm(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), data = df_1982)

```

---

- The output is similar to what you would see in Stata. You can show it in a table, print it out, export it, and use it for coefficient plots.

```{r}

summary(my_ols)

```

---

## Bonus: Running a regression

.pull-left[

- Why logging, you say?

- It respects the assumptions of the model (linear, additive, etc.).

]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = FALSE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  ggplot(aes(log(gdpPercap), lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_ipsum_rc()

# Plotting

## The grammar of graphics

.pull-left[

- **Reminder**: Always, always, ALWAYS plot your data. Please.

- The most popular (and coolest) plotting library in R is `ggplot2`. It follows principles based on the **grammar of graphics**

- What you should remember about this is that a plot is based on different layers that can be combined to create pretty much everything.

- Let's look at a basic example.

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A plot is like an onion."}
knitr::include_graphics("gog.png")
```
]

## Plotting with `ggplot2`

.pull-left[

### Mappings and geoms

- The two crucial starting points are the `aesthetic mappings` and the `geoms`. These tell your graph what variables are mapped to what, and what geometry we're going to use to represent them.
- For two variables, a scatterplot is common:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, #<< 
             y = lifeExp)) + #<< 
  geom_point() #<< 

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()

```
]

---

## Plotting with `ggplot2`

.pull-left[

### Adding a geom

- But just playing around with things, we can get very different results.
- We can add a geometry that shows a smooth line (or a linear model). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, 
             y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() #<< 

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

```
]

---

## Plotting with `ggplot2`

.pull-left[

### Adding a geom

- We can also add an aesthetic to encode continent as color.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, 
             y = lifeExp, 
             color = continent)) + #<< 
  geom_point()

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, 
             y = lifeExp, 
             color = continent)) +
  geom_point()

```
]

## Anatomy of a ggplot

`r chunk_reveal("my_gap")`

```{r my_gap, include = FALSE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point() +
  aes(color = continent) +
  aes(size = pop) +
  theme_ipsum_tw() +
  labs(title = "Income and life expectancy in 1982",
       x = "GDP per capita",
       y = "Life expectancy",
       color = "Continent",
       size = "Population") +
  scale_color_manual(values = palette_42("i42_bright"))
